# Traffic_signal_Object_detection

## Problem Statement

Traffic sign recognition is a multi-class classification problem with unbalanced class frequencies. Traffic signs can provide a wide range of variations between classes in terms of color, shape, and the presence of pictograms or text. However, there exist subsets of classes (e. g., speed limit signs) that are very similar to each other.
Here we have to determine the boundary box where the traffic signal is and we have to classify which class the signal belongs to
Identifying boundary box is a Regression model and Classifying the traffic signal is a Classification Model.
